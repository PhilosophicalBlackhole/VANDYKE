#Step-by-Step Explanation
Setup YOLOv3
Load the configuration, weights, and COCO class names (you need the files: yolov3.cfg, yolov3.weights, and coco.names).

Load the video
Use OpenCVâ€™s VideoCapture to open your source video.

Prepare to write output video
We decide an output frame size (400x400 here) for cropped frames and prepare the output writer.

Processing frames
For each frame:

Create a blob to normalize and resize the frame for YOLO input.
Run the forward pass through YOLO to get detections.
Filter detections by confidence and use Non-Maximum Suppression to remove overlaps.
Select bounding box
We pick the largest detected bounding box for cropping (adjust logic to your interest).

Crop and resize
Crop detected bounding box area from frame, resize it to the output size, and write it as a frame to output video.

Fallbacks
If no detection happens or if crop is invalid, write a black frame (you can customize behavior).

Release resources
Save output file and clean up.
